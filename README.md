# py-maze
Fun little python learning experiment to build and solve mazes in different ways. The initial goal
was to try and implement the A* solver on my own just looking at general descriptions of it. Which
means I needed to be able to generate mazes from scratch. Initially I took heavy reference from 
{insert when I find it} which would generate mazes and render them to an image file I found online.
I then decided to implement it in Qt as it is what I was most familiar with for python guis. These
days I've implemented multiple generators(Huge thanks to Jamis Buck's blog: https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/under-the-hood/),
as well as multiple solvers past A*. I also got fancy with the generating & solving the mazes visually,
which helped debugging implemintation considerably.
